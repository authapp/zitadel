## 🎯 **Initiative Objectives**

### **Phase B3: Query Testing Completeness** (Priority: HIGH)
**Current:** 50% → **Target:** 90%

**Completed Today:**
1. ✅ Created comprehensive password-complexity-queries integration test
   - 11 test cases covering:
     - Policy inheritance (built-in → instance → org)
     - Password validation business logic
     - Multi-tenant isolation
     - Policy changes and updates
     - Edge cases
   - **Status:** 6/11 passing (needs instanceID fixes)

2. ✅ Created comprehensive lockout-policy-queries integration test
   - 10 test cases covering:
     - Policy inheritance
     - Lockout logic validation
     - Password/OTP attempt checking
     - Policy updates and removal
     - Multi-tenant isolation
   - **Status:** 1/10 passing (needs instanceID fixes)

3. ✅ Enhanced query classes with business logic methods:
   - `PasswordComplexityQueries`:
     - `validatePassword()` - Password validation
     - `getPasswordRequirements()` - Requirements extraction
     - `getPasswordRequirementsDescription()` - Human-readable description
   - `LockoutPolicyQueries`:
     - `shouldLockoutPassword()` - Password lockout check
     - `shouldLockoutOTP()` - OTP lockout check
     - `shouldShowFailureDetails()` - Security setting check

## 🐛 **Known Issues**

### **Issue 1: Event InstanceID Mismatch**
**Severity:** Medium  
**Impact:** 15 tests failing across 2 test files

**Problem:**
Events pushed to eventstore use generated instanceIDs (e.g., `test-instance-123`) but the eventstore is initialized with a fixed instanceID (`test-instance`). This causes projection filtering to miss events.

**Solution:**
Need to either:
- Use consistent instanceID in all event pushes
- Initialize eventstore with dynamic instanceID per test
- Update projection to handle both scenarios

**Files Affected:**
- `password-complexity-queries.integration.test.ts` (5 tests failing)
- `lockout-policy-queries.integration.test.ts` (9 tests failing)

### **Issue 2: Query Table Name Mismatch**
**Severity:** Low  
**Impact:** Some queries may use wrong table names

**Problem:**
Some queries reference `projections.password_complexity_policies` but the actual table is `password_complexity_policies_projection` (note the suffix).

**Solution:**
Verify and update all query table names to match migration schemas.
