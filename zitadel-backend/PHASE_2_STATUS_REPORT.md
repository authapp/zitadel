**Total Found:** 35 policy tests already passing!

#### What Needs Investigation
- [ ] Privacy policy commands - Check if implemented
- [ ] Notification policy commands - Check if implemented  
- [ ] Custom text commands - Check if implemented

- [ ] `addOrgLabelPolicy()` - Organization branding (colors, logos, fonts)
- [ ] `changeOrgLabelPolicy()` - Update branding
- [ ] `removeOrgLabelPolicy()` - Remove custom branding
- [ ] `addInstanceLabelPolicy()` - Instance-level branding
- [ ] `changeInstanceLabelPolicy()` - Update instance branding
- [ ] `removeInstanceLabelPolicy()` - Remove instance branding

**Privacy Policy Commands (4 commands):**
- [ ] `addOrgPrivacyPolicy()` - Set privacy policy links

- [ ] `removeCustomText()` - Remove custom translations

### Implementation Plan

#### Step 1: Audit Existing Policy Commands (Day 1)
**Action:** Check which policy commands already exist

```bash
# Check for policy command files
ls -la src/lib/command/policy/
ls -la src/lib/command/org/*policy*

# Check for policy test files
ls -la test/integration/commands/*policy*

# Run all policy tests
npm run test:integration -- policy
```

**Expected Findings:**
- Label policy: ‚úÖ Likely complete (19 tests passing)
- Privacy policy: ‚ö†Ô∏è Need to verify
- Notification policy: ‚ö†Ô∏è Need to verify
- Custom text: ‚ö†Ô∏è Need to verify

#### Step 2: Implement Missing Commands (Days 2-7)
**For each missing command:**
1. Review Zitadel Go implementation
2. Create command function with validation
3. Create write model if needed
4. Implement event generation
5. Add to Commands class
6. Create integration tests (5+ tests per command)

#### Step 3: Test & Verify (Days 8-10)
- Run full test suite
- Verify projection integration
- Test query layer
- Document completion
