## 🎯 IMMEDIATE ACTION ITEMS

### For Week 13 (Starting Now)

**Step 1:** Read Zitadel Go source files
```bash
# Review these files
/Users/dsharma/authapp/zitadel/internal/command/idp.go
/Users/dsharma/authapp/zitadel/internal/command/idp_oidc_config.go
/Users/dsharma/authapp/zitadel/internal/command/idp_oauth_config.go
```

**Step 2:** Create command structure
```bash
mkdir -p src/lib/command/idp
touch src/lib/command/idp/idp-template-commands.ts
touch src/lib/command/idp/idp-template-write-model.ts
```

**Step 3:** Implement first command
- Implement `addIDPTemplate()` command
- Create write model for IDP template state
- Register command in Commands class

**Step 4:** Write first test
```bash
touch test/integration/commands/idp-template.test.ts
# Write test for addIDPTemplate()
```

**Step 5:** Run tests
