## 🔧 KEY TECHNICAL FEATURES

### Instance Actions vs Org Actions

**Org-Level Actions (Already Implemented):**
- Scoped to specific organization
- Can vary per organization
- Managed by org admins
- Events: `action.added`, `action.changed`, etc.

**Instance-Level Actions (NEW - Just Implemented):**
- Apply across ALL organizations
- System-wide defaults and overrides
- Managed by instance admins
- Events: `instance.action.added`, `instance.action.changed`, etc.

**Use Cases:**
1. **Compliance actions** - Required for all orgs (GDPR, HIPAA)
2. **Security policies** - Instance-wide security checks
3. **Audit logging** - Centralized audit requirements
4. **Rate limiting** - Global rate limit enforcement
5. **Default behaviors** - Fallback actions for all orgs

### Instance Flows vs Org Flows

**Instance Flows (NEW):**
- Trigger points that execute before org flows
- Can enforce mandatory behaviors
- Cannot be overridden by org admins
- Example: Security scans on all logins
