1. **Transaction Safety** - ACID properties maintained
2. **SQL Injection Protection** - Properly parameterized queries
3. **Concurrency Handling** - No deadlocks or race conditions
4. **Unicode Support** - Full UTF-8 including emojis
5. **Large Payloads** - Handles 1MB+ events

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well ✅
1. **Incremental approach** - Priority 1 then Priority 2
2. **Real database** - Found PostgreSQL null byte issue
3. **Concurrent testing** - Exposed race conditions early
4. **Large payloads** - Validated scalability

### What to Watch Out For ⚠️
1. **Null bytes** - PostgreSQL limitation (documented)
2. **Batch size** - 100 events is optimal (tested)
3. **Case sensitivity** - Usernames are case-sensitive (tested)
4. **Transaction timeouts** - Long-running txs may timeout (untested)

## 📊 Usage Recommendations

### ✅ Safe to Use Now
- User registration with unique emails
- Building projections with reducers
- Catch-up subscriptions
- Multi-tenant applications
- Production workloads (moderate)

### ⚠️ Consider Testing More
- Very high concurrent load (1000+ ops/sec)
- Very large events (>10MB)
- Network partition scenarios
- Database failover

## 🚀 Next Steps

You have completed **Option B (Priority 1)** and **Option C (Priority 2)**!

### ✅ Completed
- [x] Priority 1 tests (+18 tests)
- [x] Priority 2 tests (+9 tests)
